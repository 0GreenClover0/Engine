## What is it?
Guiding Light is a game developed along it's own game engine in 4 months.

## Story
You're a lighthouse keeper and a courier‚Ä¶ at once. In "Guiding Light", a casual time-management game, you operate alone in the Pole of Cold. And you‚Äôre the only one who can feed the penguins! Guide the ships, pick-up the food rations, and upgrade your lighthouse. Get ready to prevent shipwrecks and master the polar night!

## How to play?

## Engine
Our engine is based on **Entity-Component architecture used by Unity**. We use **DirectX 11** as our graphics API (initially it was OpenGL, we decided to port it). Editor's UI was made with **ImGui** and it's extensions: **ImGuizmo, ImPlot**. 

## Editor
<p align="center">

</p>
We developed our own editor along with countless tools and functionalities:

* Scene and prefab loading
* Gizmos
* Curve editors
* Debug drawings
* Debug logging
* Shader hot-swapping

## EngineHeaderTool
To speed up our work, we wrote a python script that generates (de)serialization code
for all Components, just like [UnrealHeaderTool](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/BuildTools/UnrealHeaderTool/). (We are very proud of that.)

## Rendering
We managed to implement a couple of rendering algorithms:
* Screen Space Reflection
* Screen Space Refraction
* Volumetric light scattering
* Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
* Particles (and particle emitters)
* Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing (FXAA)
* Gerstner waves (for water geometry)
* Shadow mapping (also including point lights)
* Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows
